### PyTorch MemoryViz (VS Code Extension)

Explore PyTorch CUDA memory traces directly in VS Code.

This extension embeds the upstream PyTorch MemoryViz UI inside a webview and bundles all dependencies. You can open `.pickle`/`.pkl` or profiler `.json` traces.

See https://pytorch.org/blog/understanding-gpu-memory-1/ for more information how to record the traces.

#### Features
- Offline MemoryViz UI
- Open traces from the Explorer (context menu) or “Open With → PyTorch MemoryViz”
- Remote-friendly: works over SSH/WSL; files are read on the remote, not the local machine

#### How to use
1. Install “PyTorch MemoryViz” from the Marketplace.
2. Open your workspace that contains trace files (`.pickle`, `.pkl`, `.json`).
3. Open a trace in any of these ways:
   - Right-click a file in Explorer → “Open with PyTorch MemoryViz”
   - Right-click → “Open With…” → select “PyTorch MemoryViz”
   - From the MemoryViz tab’s toolbar, choose “Choose files (remote)” to pick traces from your remote workspace, or “Choose files (local)” to pick from your machine
4. Interact with the chart: zoom, pan, and click a block to inspect the stack.

Tip: To generate traces, see PyTorch documentation for `torch.cuda.memory._snapshot()` or `torch.profiler.profile(..., profile_memory=True)`.

#### Requirements
- VS Code 1.80+
- Trace files generated by PyTorch (CUDA memory snapshot `.pickle`/`.pkl`, or profiler `.json`)

#### Privacy & Security
- All trace files are processed locally within your VS Code session

#### Feedback / Issues
- Open issues and feature requests at the GitHub repository.
